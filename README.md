_**Comments in feature files (Cucumber)**_<br>
You can add your comments in the lines followed by the keywords:<br>
`Feature`, `Scenario`, `Scenario Outline`, or `Examples`.<br>
Also, you can use `#` for line comments.<br><br>
_**Comments in property files**_<br>
Comment lines in .properties files are denoted by the number sign `#`,<br> 
or the exclamation mark `!` as the first non-blank character<br><br>

The syntax for writing comments in XML is similar to that of HTML.
```
<!-- This is a comment -->
```
_**Property File and properties**_<br>
All the global properties and values that can be defined by the user shall be defined in the property file.<br> 
This will allow you to run your tests with different configurations without recompiling your code.
